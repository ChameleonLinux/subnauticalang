Mission type: Search & Rescue
Mission target: Crew of the Mongolian Empire vessel 'Degasi'
Mission location: Ariadne Arm, 3 light years beyond furthest phasegate
Mission contact: Emissary Jochi Khasar, Aurora Passenger Quarters, Room 4

Mission brief:
Aurora is due to pass through System 2001 approximately 13 months post-launch. The Aurora is scheduled to perform a gravity slingshot maneuver around planet 4546B. This will bring you within range of the Degasi's last known position.

The Mongolian Empire lost contact with private vessel 'Degasi' 18 months after it left colonized space. The Empire has purchased passage aboard Aurora for Emissary Khasar, and your orders are to afford him every reasonable facility to locate and, if appropriate, retrieve Degasi crewmembers, without compromising the primary mission.

Degasi crew manifesto has been distributed to senior officers in a separate data package.

Mission classification:
Aurora crew should not be informed of this mission until such time as their co-operation in locating or retrieving Degasi crew is required. It should be stressed that humanitarian auxiliary missions fall outside normal remuneration structures.",

The furthest reaches of inhabited space are due to expand, as Alterra Technologies launches the Aurora, a newly-constructed capital ship carrying state-of-the-art phasegate technology, bound for the Ariadne Arm. 

The Aurora will travel from spacedock on the edge of Alterra space, making 324 consecutive warpgate jumps through nine different trans-gov authorities, and arrive on the far side of the Ariadne Arm of solar systems in approximately three months. From there the 100-strong crew will pilot the ship beyond the furthest warpgate, arriving in Solar System 84763 approximately 12 months later.

There the elite team of engineers will begin a 6 month construction project which will see the new phasegate fully operational less than two years from today. The crew will be eager to complete the work on time, since the phasegate represents their fastest route home.

Alterra Technologies currently operates 9% of all phasegates in the galaxy. If the Aurora's mission is successful Alterra will have outmaneuvered various private interests in the Mongolian Empire, which have to date established a number of outposts and mining operations in the region.

The launch ceremony proceeded with the usual fanfare...",

    "EncyDesc_IslandsPDABase1Interior": "I am Paal Torgal, Chief Executive Officer of the Torgaljin Corporation. My crew and I were marooned here 5 weeks ago when our ship was struck by some kind of weapon. 

We constructed a habitat using materials reclaimed from the ship. We survived by cultivating indigenous flora. The biochemistry imprint I commissioned for my son has already paid for itself. He has grown enough food to last us a month.

Now I fear for our safety. A mercenary I hired for the journey, Marguerit Maida, is increasingly disturbed. She insists we abandon this site and establish a habitat underwater. I fear she may take steps to sabotage our habitat here to enforce her own agenda. Nonetheless, and against my better judgement, I have acquiesced to her request to scout for a suitable aquatic site. My hope is she will quickly realize how unforgiving the ocean is, and abandon this foolish ambition.",

She entered hand-to-hand combat with an alien shark and brought home it's TEETH. Now we can fabricate all the enamel we need.

On one hand, that is the most badass thing I ever heard, and now I'm sitting in this sweet observatory watching biters tap harmlessly at the glass.

On the other hand, was it worth it? Did that creature survive? How fast do their teeth grow? Is there a way to manufacture materials without harming the ecosystem here?

All the same, the life down here is INCREDIBLE. Marguerit has been bringing back the wildest specimens you could imagine. OK, the plantlife is inedible. I learnt that the hard way. But the fish... down here they GLOW. There's one that's 90% eyeball. Snakes the length of two glass corridor sections.

It's not easy without a proper lab and equipment, but sometimes the old fashioned way - observing, taking notes, testing theories - reveals things a spectroscopic analysis never would. 

For example, I've been watching the sea snakes that make their homes in the purple mushrooms that grow here. They await their prey, and strike when small herbivores stray too close. What they don't consume settles on the seabed, which fertilizes the mushrooms, which feed the herbivores, and the chain continues. Co-evolution just blows my mind.",

I've hauled starwhals to Neptune, plasteel to the Federation... this family operates nine different mining colonies across the Ariadne Arm. She thinks I don't know what a Cyclops is?! She thinks she's in charge? Her contract still says otherwise.

So she wants to build a habitat at 700m below sea level, a kilometre east of here. And she needs Baat and I to pull it off. She's got it into her head that there's no rescue coming. That she can save us if she just acts recklessly enough.

And I just cannot goddamn tell whether it's the stupidest idea I ever heard, or my only hope. I turned 80 years old last week. I thought I had another 80 in me yet. But stuck here, there's no swapping out my liver when the old one fails. Down here, I'm mortal. And I'm running out of time.

So it's my responsibility to make a decision. Return to the island and hope whatever knocked the Degasi out of the sky won't do the same to the rescue ship, or take us deeper in search of answers. And all the while be hoping old age gets me before the seamonsters do.

I'll give Maida just one thing. She was right about these caves. There's enough lithium here to fabricate a hundred tons of plasteel. Enough for a damn FLEET of submarines. There was nothing anyone could have done to avoid crashing here, but I was right to order the detour.

I've started preparing for the operation. The kid's alien petting zoo was worth chipping in for. No need to visit the surface for stalker teeth when he's got a whole school of them whipped to eat the fish from the palm of his hand. I've started defanging them when the Torgals are sleeping, and stockpiling enamel and metal ores for construction of the sub.

Might be I can use a dive reel and compass to chart a way out. Might be I'm going to breathe my last down here.

Entry 2
Two hours since the first pod sunk. I've tried exploring the area. There's no air pockets. No overhead exit. If I had plasteel I could build an air tank, a submersible, anything! But as it is I can only explore so far before I'm forced back to this lifepod. I have to find another way.

Entry 3
I've managed to cobble together a rebreather and explore a bit further. I've found an incline heading up. Not clear whether it's part of the cave wall, or the way out. One way to know for sure.

Entry 4
Daylight! It was definitely daylight, I'm sure of it. I swam as far as I could. Next time I have to go past the point of no return and take my chances.
